# ImprovisedMedicine_Rimworld
My first attempt at making a Rimworld mod. I always felt like there should be something between Healroot and Regular medicine so i went ahead and made that.

It requires the Medicine Production research and can be crafter at a drug production table with 2x Herbal Medicine.

Currently I'm unsure if I like the recipe. I don't want it to be too cheap to create the Improvised Medicine but I also don't want to be too difficult to make. For now the 2x Herbal Medicine recipe will stay.
